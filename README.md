Today i'll start a new adventure, txf to a new team and working for some C++ projects which contains almost millions lines of pure C++ code.
It will be an extremely exciting and important adventure for me, ignore any other things.

And here thks for dahua's HR, not put me into the blacklist and still leave a chance for me, although i reject it, finally.

GO ALEX GO!
